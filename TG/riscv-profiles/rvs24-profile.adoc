= RVS24 Profile

//: This is the Preamble

[WARNING]
.This document is in the development state.

Do not use for implementations.  Assume everything can change.

== Introduction

This document captures the current proposal for the RVS24 profile
family. RVS24 is intended to be the first major release of the RVS
series of RISC-V Application Processor Profile.

RVS profiles are intended to be used for soft CPU designs as commonly
implemented on an FPGA.  In addition to generally being more resource
constrained than typical ASIC designs, soft CPUs feature unique
resource and design tradeoffs compared to traditional designs.

The RVS profile family is intended to run customized and/or embedded
variations of supervisor mode operating systems.  The RVS profile
family includes 32-bit and 64-bit profiles.  Like those in the RVB
profile family, the RVS profiles are explicitly not attempting to
ensure binary compatibility for kernel, operating system, and
application distributions.  Rather, the RVS profile family is
targeting source level compatibility, and the extension mandates and
options reflect the ability to select options at that level.

== RVS24 Profiles

User-mode and supervisor-mode profiles, for both 32-bit and 64-bit,
are specified in this family.

=== RVS24U64 Profiles

The RVS24U64 profile specifies the ISA features available to user-mode
execution environments in 64-bit RVS applications processors.

==== RVS24U64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVS24U64 and is little-endian.  As
per the unprivileged architecture specification, the `ecall`
instruction causes a requested trap to the execution environment.

==== RVS24U64 Mandatory Extensions

The following mandatory extensions are also in RVB23U64.

- *M* Integer multiplication and division.
- *A* Atomic instructions.
- *Zicsr*  CSR instructions.
- *Zicntr* Base counters and timers.
- *Ziccif* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and
  coherence PMAs must support instruction fetch, and any instruction
  fetches of naturally aligned power-of-2 sizes up to min(ILEN,XLEN)
  (i.e., 32 bits for RVS24) are atomic.
- *Ziccrse* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must support RsrvEventual.
- *Zicclsm* Misaligned loads and stores to main memory regions with both the
  cacheability and coherence PMAs must be supported.

NOTE: It is possible, and may be common, that Zicclsm is emulated at a
higher privilege level and therefore provides very slow performance.

- *Za64rs* Reservation sets are contiguous, naturally aligned, and a
   maximum of 64 bytes.

==== RVS24U64 Optional Extensions

RVS24U64 has the profile options listed below.

===== Localized Options

==== RVS24U64 Recommendations

Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
exceptions on attempts to execute unimplemented opcodes.

=== RVS24S64 Profile

The RVS24S64 profile specifies the ISA features available to a
supervisor-mode execution environment in 64-bit applications
processors.  RVS24S64 is based on privileged architecture version
1.13.

NOTE: Priv 1.13 is still being defined.

==== RVS24S64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVS24S64 and is little-endian.
The `ecall` instruction operates as per the unprivileged architecture
specification.  An `ecall` in user mode causes a contained trap to
supervisor mode.  An `ecall` in supervisor mode causes a requested
trap to the execution environment.

==== RVS24S64 Mandatory Extensions

The following unprivileged extensions are mandatory:

- The RVS24S64 mandatory unprivileged extensions include all the
mandatory unprivileged extensions in RVS24U64.

- *Zifencei*  Instruction-Fetch Fence.

NOTE: Zifencei is mandated as it is the only standard way to support
instruction-cache coherence in RVS24 application processors.  A new
instruction-cache coherence mechanism is under development
(tentatively named Zjid) which might be added as an option in the
future.

The following privileged extensions are mandatory, and are also
mandatory in RVB23S64.

- *Ss1p13*  Supervisor Architecture version 1.13.

NOTE: Ss1p13 supersedes Ss1p12 but is not yet ratified.

- *Svbare* The `satp` mode Bare must be supported.

- *Sv39* Page-Based 39-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Svade* Page-fault exceptions are raised when a page is accessed
   when A bit is clear, or written when D bit is clear.

- *Ssccptr* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and
   coherence PMAs must support hardware page-table reads.

- *Sstvecd* `stvec.MODE` must be capable of holding the value 0
  (Direct).  When `stvec.MODE=Direct`, `stvec.BASE` must be capable of
  holding any valid four-byte-aligned address.

- *Sstvala* stval must be written with the faulting virtual address
  for load, store, and instruction page-fault, access-fault, and
  misaligned exceptions, and for breakpoint exceptions other than
  those caused by execution of the EBREAK or C.EBREAK instructions.
  For illegal-instruction exceptions, stval must be written with the
  faulting instruction.

- *Sstc* supervisor-mode timer interrupts.

- *Ssu64xl* `sstatus.UXL` must be capable of holding the value 2
(i.e., UXLEN=64 must be supported).

If *Zihpm* is implemented, the following extensions are mandatory:

- *Sscounterenw* For any hpmcounter that is not read-only zero, the
   corresponding bit in scounteren must be writable.

- *Sscofpmf* Count Overflow and Mode-Based Filtering.

==== RVS24S64 Optional Extensions

RVS24S64 has the same unprivileged options as RVS24U64.

===== Localized Options

There are no privileged localized options in RVS24S64.

===== Development Options

There are no privileged development options in RVS24S64.

===== Expansion Options

The following extensions are mandatory in RVB23U64 but are expansion
options in RVS24U64:

- *Svnapot* NAPOT Translation Contiguity

- *Svpbmt* Page-Based Memory Types

- *Svinval* Fine-Grained Address-Translation Cache Invalidation

The following privileged expansion options in RVB23S64 are also
options in RVS24S64:

- *Ssnpm* Pointer masking, with `senvcfg.PME` supporting at minimum,
   settings PMLEN=0 and PMLEN=7.

- *H* The hypervisor extension.

When the hypervisor extension is implemented, the following are also mandatory:

- *Ssstateen* Supervisor-mode view of the state-enable extension.  The
   supervisor-mode (`sstateen0-3`) and hypervisor-mode (`hstateen0-3`)
   state-enable registers must be provided.

- *Shcounterenw* For any `hpmcounter` that is not read-only zero, the corresponding bit in `hcounteren` must be writable.

- *Shvstvala* `vstval` must be written in all cases described above for `stval`.

- *Shtvala* `htval` must be written with the faulting guest physical
   address in all circumstances permitted by the ISA.

- *Shvstvecd* `vstvec.MODE` must be capable of holding the value 0 (Direct).
  When `vstvec.MODE`=Direct, `vstvec.BASE` must be capable of holding
  any valid four-byte-aligned address.

- *Shvsatpa* All translation modes supported in `satp` must be supported in `vsatp`.

- *Shgatpa* For each supported virtual memory scheme SvNN supported in
  `satp`, the corresponding hgatp SvNNx4 mode must be supported.  The
  `hgatp` mode Bare must also be supported.

- If the hypervisor extension is implemented and pointer masking
  (Ssnpm) is supported then `henvcfg.PME` must support at minimum,
  settings PMLEN=0 and PMLEN=7.

The following privileged expansion options are also present in RVB23S64:

- *Sv48* Page-Based 48-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Sv57* Page-Based 57-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Svadu* Hardware A/D bit updates.

- *Zkr*  Entropy CSR.

- *Sdext* Debug triggers

- *Ssstrict* No non-conforming extensions are present.  Attempts to
   execute unimplemented opcodes or access unimplemented CSRs in the
   standard or reserved encoding spaces raises an illegal instruction
   exception that results in a contained trap to the supervisor-mode
   trap handler.

NOTE: Ssstrict does not prescribe behavior for the custom encoding
spaces or CSRs.

- *Svvptc* Transitions from invalid to valid PTEs will be visible in
   bounded time without an explicit SFENCE.

==== RVS24S64 Recommendations

- Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
  exceptions when attempting to execute unimplemented opcodes.
