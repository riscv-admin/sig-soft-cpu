# Composable Extensions (CX) Task Group Charter

## Executive Summary

This Charter governs the TG for a Composable Extensions (CX) framework
enabling robust composition of multiple independently authored composable
custom extensions, alongside legacy custom extensions, conflict-free in
one RISC-V system.

By multiplexing the custom opcode space, and adopting common software
and hardware interop interfaces, CX can provide *uniform* extension naming,
discovery, and versioning, error handling, state context management,
extension hardware module reuse, and stable software binaries for each
target system -- all without a central management authority.

## Introduction - the custom extensions reuse problem

RISC-V reserves the custom-\* opcode space, enabling anyone to create
new custom extensions and their software libraries. However, composition
of multiple extensions is unobtainable because RISC-V custom extensions are
unmanaged, lacking standards or uniformity; the use of one extension in
a system often precludes use of another extension because they may have
conflicting custom instructions, or incompatible means of extension
discovery, versioning, state management, etc. This leads to disjoint
solution silos and fragmentation of the RISC-V ecosystem.

## Objectives

The Composable Extensions (CX) Task Group(s) will specify ISA extensions
and software (API, ABI) and hardware (logic interface, metadata)
interfaces enabling independent creation of extensible processors,
composable extensions, extension libraries, and extension hardware,
that compose readily and harmoniously. The deliverables of the TG
should achieve the following objectives:

*CX Multiplexing:* Operationally, a *CX Mux* extension, and CX API and
ABI, enable software to *discover* that a CX is available, to *select*
it and to *select* its current CX *state context*, to *issue* its custom
*CX instructions*, and to *signal* errors; and then discover that another
CX is available, select it, issue its instructions, and so forth.

*CX State Contexts:* CX instructions may access the current CX's
current state context. CX instructions are the only means to access
CX state. A CX state context may also have *CX-scoped* CSRs *(CXRs)*,
accessed by uniform CXR instructions. There may be any number of
state contexts, per CX, per system, with an arbitrary, dynamic, software
managed hart-to-CX-context mapping. A privileged access control mechanism
will efficiently grant/deny access to CX contexts by less privileged
software. In such systems, stateful CXs require a uniform method for
OS CX context management.

*Modular Hardware:* CX-compliant extensions should be implementable in
self-contained logic known as a *CX Unit* that attaches to a CPU implementation
using a specified *CX Unit (CXU) logic interface (CXU-LI)*.  Each CXU
implements one or more CXs. In response to a CX instruction, a CPU delegates
the instruction to the hart's currently selected CX within the CXU.  In
general, a DAG of CPUs and CXUs can be automatically composed in a single
system, providing the advantages of reuse and portability at the logic level. 


## Tenets

Further to the objectives, the CX TG should be guided these tenets when
defining the extension: composability, conflict-freedom, decentralization,
stable binaries, composable hardware, uniformity (of scope, naming,
discovery, versioning, error signaling, state management, access control),
frugality, security, and longevity. In particular:

1. *Composability:* The behavior of a CX or CX library does not change
when used with other CXs.

2. *Conflict-freedom:* Any CX may use the *CX subset* of the custom-\*
opcode instructions, without conflict with other CXs or ordinary (legacy)
non-CX custom extensions.

3. *Decentralization:* Anyone may define or use a CX without coordination
with others, and without resort to a central authority.

4. *Stable binaries:* CX library *binaries* compose without rewriting,
recompilation or relinking.

5. *Composable hardware:* Adding a CXU to a system does not require
internal modification of CPU or CXU implementations. A CXU *may be*
implemented in a nonproprietary HDL such as Verilog.

6. *Uniformity:* of *scope:* at least: instructions may access integer
registers and may be stateful; of *naming, discovery, versioning:*
CX software has a uniform means to discover if specific CX or CX version
is available.

7. *Frugality:* Prefer simpler induced hardware and shorter code paths.

8. *Security:* The specifications include a vulnerability assessment
and do not facilitate new side channel attacks.

9. *Longevity:* The specifications define how each interface may be
versioned over decades, and incorporate mechanisms to improve forwards
compatibility.

### Deliverables

The TG should deliver a specification or specifications for the following:

1. *CX-Mux-ISA* defines new ISA specs for: a. CX multiplexing and error
signaling (unpriv); b. CX access control (priv).

2. *CX-State-ISA* defines new (per each CX) ISA specs for: a. CXR
instructions (unpriv); b. CX State Context CXRs (priv).

3. *CX-SW* defines: a. CX-API: CX Runtime API for uniform software access
to CXs. b. CX-ABI: application binary interface governing disciplined
use of CX-\*-ISA.

4. *CX-HW* defines *optional* specs for: a. CXU-LI: reusable CX unit
logic interface which may be extendable to a NoC; b. CXU-MD: metadata
format describing systems, CPUs, CXUs, and NoC to enable automatic composition
of CPU + CXU complexes.

### Acceptance criteria

Each deliverable must be implemented and proven in nontrivial interop
plugfest scenarios involving multiple processors x extensions x extension
libraries x OSs.

## Exclusions

Not every arbitrary custom extension can be a composable extension.
For example, the current scope excludes custom instructions
that can alter control flow.

The CX TG is focused on the minimum viable standards *enabling*
practical composition of extensions and software. Further standards
for infrastructure and tooling e.g. for CX packages, debug, profile,
formal specification of CX interface contracts, CX library metadata,
and tools, are _out of scope_.

## Collaborations

The CX framework will enable many ongoing and future unpriv extension
TGs to provide their extension as a composable extension. CX multiplexing
reduces the opcode and CSR impact of such extensions to zero, extending
the life of the 32b encodings. In addition, CX discovery and versioning
provides such extensions a uniform forwards compatible versioning story.
A modular CXU implementation would enable that extension in any
CXU-LI-compliant CPU cores.

### Overlaps (probably many, more TBD)

* CX discovery API may overlap uniform discovery TG;

* the CX scoped CSR feature may overlap with CSR indirection.

## History

In 2019, the RISC-V Foundation FPGA soft processor SIG members, determined
to advance RISC-V as the preeminent ecosystem for FPGA SoCs, committed to
"Propose extensions ... to enable interoperable RISC-V FPGA platforms
and applications". SIG members set out to define standards by which
FPGAs' extensible RISC-V cores might enable a marketplace of reusable
and composable custom extensions and libraries. Through 2019-2022,
members met to define the *minimum viable set* of interop interfaces
culminating in the
[Draft Proposed RISC-V Composable Custom Extensions Specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grayresearch/CX/main/spec/spec.pdf),
now proposed as a starting point for RVI CX TG work.
