============

In an effort to standardize the way custom instructions are created and shared, this SIG has launched a Task Group for Composable Custom Extensions (CX) with working documents here: [https://github.com/riscv-admin/composable-custom-extensions](https://github.com/riscv-admin/composable-custom-extensions). The TG will be producing multiple official RISC-V extensions, and is basing its efforts upon background work done from 2019-2023 by members of the SoftCPU SIG which resulted in the _Basis Spec_: [https://github.com/grayresearch/CX](https://github.com/grayresearch/CX).
